# Development status

The repository is PUBLIC. Original KingPepe code is All Rights Reserved.
Production readiness, signing and broadcasting remain false; Mainnet is disabled.

## Current bridge

Native deposits pass independent raw-evidence and finality checks, exact A+B
FROST reserve sweep, attestation, finalized Solana claim/mint and reconciliation.
Finalized BurnChecked withdrawal records drive exact Native payout planning,
independent A+B validation/signing, persist-before-broadcast delivery and finality.
Both directions use durable operation IDs and the existing accounting journal.

The bounded local service discovers withdrawal records, retains pending
liabilities and resumes without client resubmission. Missing creation history or
uncertain delivery waits. Confirmed accepted-chain or accounting contradiction
records an incident and pauses new mint/payout authorization. Read-only monitoring
may continue; no automatic repair or unpause exists.

## Final simplification

Review baseline: ab15b2f38084f024e49d8fae9a13182dfe85721d.
Tracked source files: 246 to 240. PROVENANCE.json classifies every retained file
and records the six removals: three unused facades and three duplicate FROST
readmes. No dependency, useful regression or third-party notice was removed.

IPC V3 retains pinned TLS 1.3, exact roles, deadlines and durable replay protection
without a second challenge/exporter exchange. FROST shares never cross its signing
channel. Deployment manifests V2 retain identities, authorities, configuration
and accepted deployment slots; reproducible hashes are build evidence only.
Old wire peers must be updated together. Old manifest-bound progress fails closed;
there is no automatic operational-state migration or deletion.

The separately reviewed coordinator correction is
84d8fa0f0eb830a3c9217813f9a907abf437415f. Its protected journal admits only reserve
sweep and withdrawal purposes, preserves exact intent binding and reuses a retained
aggregate after restart. Worker errors expose fixed public classes, not secrets.

## Executed local validation

These results cover the combined reviewed working tree based on the baseline
above, not an exact-SHA clean clone or certification of its parent commit.
See BRIDGE-READINESS.json and the matching GitHub Actions run for source scope.

- Windows and WSL Node: 963 PASS each, two canonical vectors each.
- Windows CurrentUser security: 139 PASS, zero failures/skips, fresh Native verifier.
- Fresh-verifier protected controller regressions: six PASS.
- Rust: 94 PASS; locked checks, formatting and Clippy passed in all four workspaces.
- Two independent fresh SBF builds matched; hashes are in BRIDGE-READINESS.json.
- Real deposit checks: 55 PASS. Round trip: 25 PASS, both directions COMPLETED.
- Withdrawal record: 29 PASS; subsequent deposit/direct-burn accounting: five PASS.
- Reconciliation: ten PASS; acceptance checkpoint: 13 PASS.
- Native reorg: eight PASS; deployment identity/authority/upgrade: 18 PASS.
- Source/provenance and secret scans passed. npm audit: zero vulnerabilities.
- Dependency/license gates passed; the bincode maintenance warning remains visible.

Historical Phase 09 evidence remains bound to
7f4bb7b3db3a61802b956aba8ee0f76d5e340772, not relabeled as later-source validation.

## Limits

This remains LOCALNET/REGTEST software, not production Windows service integration
or deployment approval. No new phase, Devnet or Mainnet work is authorized here.
Common-host compromise/availability, unaudited Noble FROST, CurrentUser-only Windows
coverage, no full-host rollback guarantee, configured RPC/attester trust and upgrade
authority remain explicit limitations. Cargo reports the unsuppressed bincode
1.3.3 unmaintained warning RUSTSEC-2025-0141. No advisory gate was weakened.
